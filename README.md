When you look up these sites does it say they are associated with other websites online? These all seem to be pretty legitimate websits how can I tell if they are "ghost sites" or not? If anyone wants a backlink on this page you should try reaching out to one of these websites and see if they will post your site on this page to give you a backlink. Whatever that is.
